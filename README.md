# Analyzing My Portfolio For Diversification Using Correlation Matrix in Python
* I was curious to see if my investment porfolio hit the sweet spot between diversification and correlation, so I plotted the 5-year returns of my investments against SPY, used linear regression to calculate the beta and correlation, and generated a correlation matrix and a heatmap.
* I concluded that my investments have a long way to go to achieve what Ray Dalio describes as the "Holy Grail". I will be identifying 10 uncorrelated stocks to increase my return-to-risk ratio

# [Project 2: Optimal Production Level Simulation](https://github.com/franklinjtan/Optimal-Production-Level-Simulation)
* Created a program simulation written in Python that will generate a production level recommendation given a set of parameters
* Used NumPy to generate a random sample of demand instances from a normal (Gaussian) distribution.
* Used matplotlib to generate a scatterplot visualization with a color scale depicting optimal ranges of production

# [Project 3: Visualizing and Forecasting Monthly Retail Trade Data](https://github.com/franklinjtan/Visualizing-and-Forecasting-Monthly-Retail-Trade-Data)
* Cleaned and prepared monthly retail trade data from the Census Burea to create a time-series of various industries from 1992 to 2022
* Used Python Pandas for data cleaning and Tableau to create visualizations

# [Project 4: Fashion Store Crawler](https://github.com/franklinjtan/fashion-store-crawler)
* Created an application that crawls the a fashion store website and extracts product information to helps users track and reduce their environmental impact.
* Scraped over 1000 product descriptions from the clothing store, The Reformation using python and selenium
* Stored the data in a hosted database (AWS RDS).
* Optimized solution by targeting unique identifier-keys like ASIN in cases where website structure changes or product becomes out-of-stock.
