# [Project 1: Optimal Production Level Simulation](https://github.com/franklinjtan/Optimal-Production-Level-Simulation)
* Created a simulation on Python that will generate a production level recommendation given a set of parameters
* Used NumPy to generate a random sample of demand instances from a normal (Gaussian) distribution.
* Used matplotlib to generate a scatterplot visualization with a color scale depicting optimal ranges of production


# [Project 2: Visualizing and Forecasting Monthly Retail Trade Data](https://github.com/franklinjtan/Visualizing-and-Forecasting-Monthly-Retail-Trade-Data)
* Cleaned and prepared monthly retail trade data from the Census Burea to create a time-series of various industries from 1992 to 2022
